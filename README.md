# LLM-powered-script-to-summarise-customer-feedback
A tool that converts raw support tickets into structured summaries for PMs.
As a PM, I'd want the following
- Clarity (can I understand the summary in 5 seconds?)
- Structure (can I easily navigate through the summary points if there are bullet points?)
- Actionable (is there an action that is suggested that I can take as a PM?)
- Consistency across tickets
- Hallucination risk
